These are a collection of scripts that I have made and/or edited to fit my needs. I hope that you find them useful as well. If there is something specific you would like to see, please don't hesitate to ask. The worst I could say is "No, I don't know how to do that." Or I could tell you to give me some time to look it up.

Hope you enjoy
